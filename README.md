# HRMDemoMavenTestNG
This repository contains a test automation script that I have written for Orange HRM dashboard application for selfstudy purpose.

Initially it was created without following an automation framework. But later Page Object Model framework was followed when creating the test files.

Old test files are located in src/test/java/com.maven.testng package

New test files are stored in below locations
Test classes - src/test/java/com.maven.testng.tests
Function classes - src/test/java/com.maven.testng.function
Page Classes - src/test/java/com.maven.testng.page
Utility Classes - src/test/java/com.maven.testng.util

Link to application - https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/
